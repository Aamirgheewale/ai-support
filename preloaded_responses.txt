## NORMALIZATION RULES
## ====================
## Before checking against preloaded responses, user messages are normalized:
## 1. Convert to lowercase
## 2. Trim whitespace
## 3. Remove punctuation: .,!?;:
## 4. Replace multiple spaces with single space
##
## Examples:
##   "Hello!" → "hello"
##   "Hi there!!!" → "hi there"
##   "HELP ME" → "help me"
##   "What is VTU?" → "what is vtu"


## MATCHING PRIORITY
## ==================
## 1. Check exact match in PRELOADED_RESPONSES_MAP
## 2. Check partial matches (startsWith) in PARTIAL_MATCHES array
## 3. Check special phrase handlers (ending phrases, agent intent)
## 4. If no match, send to AI/LLM for response


## NOTES
## =====
## - Preloaded responses have ~600ms artificial latency to simulate typing
## - These responses do NOT call the AI/LLM, saving API costs
## - Partial matches are checked in order - first match wins
## - Case-insensitive matching for all responses
## - Punctuation is stripped before matching
